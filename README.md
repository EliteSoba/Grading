Grading
=======

We're grading the Restaurant project v2.1. So in the spirit of terrible Java GUIs, a quickly written GUI to assist graders in grading the Restaurant project v2.1

Notes
=====
 + ~~Does not accept partial credit~~ (Fixed with v2.1 update)
 + ~~Grader still has to manually add comments when points are deducted (Although it creates a list of filler)~~
 + ~~Goal for next edition: Add ability to annotate deductions on the spot~~ (DONE)
 + Goal for v2.2 edition: Allow parsing of text file to create necessary panels
 + Goal for v2.2 edition: Create Additional Comments panel
 + Goal for next edition: Prompt for comment upon removal of points
 + Goal for next edition: Work on reset button. Also, perhaps an ID section to identify each grade with a student
 + Goal for next edition: Display point totals for each milestone (ex: Milestone 2.2A lost 2 points (18/20))
 + Goal for v2.2 edition: Update dispute date
 + ~~In the time it took me to write this, my submissions_v2 clone still hasn't completed~~ (Same with 2.1 clone and update)
